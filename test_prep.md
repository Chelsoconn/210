20 questions/ 3 hours/ 9 min a question

Typically, we are interested in the return value of an expression,  whether there are side effects, whether new objects are created, or  whether something is being output. Be precise, be succinct, and explain  with the highest level of clarity you can.



-   Highlight any specific syntactical conventions or technical observations where relevant.
-   Identify the fundamental concept or concepts demonstrated by the question.

In programming, we're always concerned with the output and the return  value, as well as any object mutation. We need to speak in those terms,  and not use vague words like "results." 



**How does Javascript look up a variable?** (SOLID)

The scope of a variable or function determines its' accessibility throughout the program. Once a variable is referenced, JavaScript will check within the current scope to find a variable with the same name.  If it is not resolved, it will search in a lexical manner the subsequant parent scopes.  Lexical scoping is determined by the structure of the code, not the execution.  As such, variables will resolve by traversing the scope hierarchy.  It will search through this scope chain incrementally until it reaches the global scope.  If at any point, the variable is resolved, the search stops. If it does not find the variable in the global scope, it will either raise a `ReferenceError` or make a property of the global object if there is no variable declaration and an assignement. 



- **Variables** 

  - Variables are pointers to values. We point to the value that a variable references.

  - Also see `identifier` in notes.md , `declaring constants` in notes.md

  - Talk about visible scope (global/local) and declared scope (block `let const class`/ function `function var`) each variable has both

  - Containers that hold data

  - After variables are declared, you can reassign using `=` operator 

  - An assignment is a standalone expression that gives a variable a new value; an initializer is the `=` combined with the expression to its right in a variable declaration.

  - A variable that is declared but not initialized or assigned a value has a value of `undefined`

  - Unless mentioned specifically, we use the term **variable** in the broadest sense possible. On this exam, that means that all of the following should be treated as variables:

    -   Variables declared with `let` or `const` `var` , properties of global object
    -   Function parameters
    -   Function names

    Note in particular that object property names **are not** variables.

    - `const` declared variables: 
      - Variables declared by `const` are block scoped, similar to variables declared by `let`, but their value cannot be changed through re-assignment. So when we try to re-assign `a` to a new value on line 4, we get an error.
      - What if a const variable hold a mutable value (array/object)?
        - The fact that `const` variables cannot be re-assigned does not mean that the value they hold is immutable. Objects that are assigned to `const` variables can be mutated.

  - ```js
    let answer = 41;
    answer = 42;
    console.log(answer)
    ```


    When JavaScript sees the declaration on line 1 of this code, it sets aside a bit of memory and stores the value `41` in that area. It also creates a variable named `answer` that we can use to access that value.

    On line 2, we *reassign* the value `42` to the variable named `answer`. That is, JavaScript makes `answer` refer to a new value. In particular, it's important to realize that we're not changing the value of `41` -- we're assigning a completely new value to the `answer` variable.

    Finally, on line 3, we log the value of the `answer`  variable to the JavaScript log. To determine what value it needs to log, JavaScript retrieves the value stored in the location used by the  variable.

    BUT `answer` isn't permanantly tied to the string '41' and it can be reassigned to any value 

  - ```js
    > let firstName; //(an initializer would be = 'Mitchell')
    = undefined
    ```

    Here, we're telling the interpreter that we want to use a variable named `firstName` to store some information. If you reference this variable in `node`, it evaluates as `undefined`: firstName was initialized to `undefined`

  

  - 

    	- So are we really returning `undefined` in a declaration? NO

     - the let keyword is a declaration or a statement which doesnt return anything
       - Note that regardless of whether we provide a value in a declaration, the variable is initialized. If we don't provide an explicit value, that  initial value is `undefined`.
     - But an *assignment* or *reassignment* are expressions and do return the value 

  





- **Primitive Values** (SOLID) (look up pyx)

  A primitive value, or data type, is represented at the lowest level of the language implementation.  These values are immutable (you cannot modify them), and because primitives are not objects, they have no methods or properties.  How then are primitive values able to call methods? For example:

  ```js 
  'hello'.slice(0,2) //he
  ```

  JavaScript actually converts the primitive, in this case `hello`, to it's corresponding object.  So the primitive string values gets a temporary object wrapper, which allows it to access these object functionalities when a method is called. After the method runs, the object wrapper is destroyed and we're left again with our primitive value.  Primitives remain lightweight and fast, but we are able to do things with the values with the help of the object's methods. Note that this does not happen with the primitives `undefined` and `null`, as they don't have an object counterpart.  

  When a variable is declared in Javascript, it allocates a space in memory to hold something.  If the variable is initialized to a primitive, the actual value will be stored in this space and the variable will point to it. When a primitive is reassigned, it will simply store the new value in this same location.  

  When a primitive value is passed in as an argument or a variable is simply assigned to another variable, it acts as pass by value, and a copy of value will be stored in a different memory spot that the new variable points to.

  ----------

  

  Use `typeof` to figure out what it is.. this will return a string:

  

  - <u>String</u>

  - <u>Number</u>

    -  JavaScript uses a floating point system to represent all numbers

  - <u>NaN</u> (considered a number)

  - <u>Undefined</u>

    -  When a variable is not defined, its value is given by `undefined`. We can describe `undefined` as representing the absence of a value. We can also explicitly use the literal `undefined`.

  - <u>Null</u>

    -  `null` is similar to `undefined`: it represents the intentional absence of a value. Often, `null` represents emptiness or nothing. The chief difference between `null` and `undefined` is that you must use `null` explicitly if you want to use it; `undefined` can arise implicitly. returns `object` with `typeof` which is wrong

  - <u>Boolean</u>

    -  Boolean values have a starring role when working with comparison operators. 
    -  Boolean values represent an "on" or "off" state.

  - <u>Symbols (ES6)</u>

  - <u>Big integers (ES9)</u>

    ```js
    'Hello, world!'     // string literal
    3.141592            // numeric literal
    true                // boolean literal
    { a: 1, b: 2 }      // object literal
    [ 1, 2, 3 ]         // array literal
    undefined           // undefined litera
    ```




- **Types and Type Conversions/Coercions** (SOLID)

See comparison rules 

There can be explicit and implicit coercion.  It's better to use explicit type coercion so you can decide what you want to do, not the engine.  Primitive values are immutable so when we discuss coercion, we are actually meaning that JavaScript returns a new value with a different type. 

These implicit coercions allow JavaScript to fail silently, which can cause issues for the programmer.  





- **Understand the Differences Between Loose and Strict Equality**

  - There is an important distinction here is between what is known as the *abstract equality operator* (`==`) and the *strict equality operator* (`===`). While both operators compare for equality and return a boolean, there is an important difference in the way they behave: When comparing for strict equality using `===`, the values are compared as-is. Values of different types will be considered unequal.

  - When using abstract equality, however, JavaScript will try to convert our values into a like type before performing the comparison.

  - We recommend using the strict equality operator (`===`) whenever possible to avoid confusing behavior and hard-to-find bugs.

  - Primitives are compared by value while objects are compared by reference.

  - Objects are only equal if we are comparing the exact same object.

  - <u>Search comparison rules</u>

  - *Objects*

    - ```js
      const person = { name: 'Victor' };
      const otherPerson = person;
      
      console.log(person === otherPerson);    // true
      ```

    - In JavaScript, every object literal creates a new object. When this object is assigned to a variable, a **reference** to the object is stored in that variable. In the example above, the only way to ensure that the two variables compare equally is to have them reference the same object.

      -  Referential equality is useful when you'd like to compare object references, rather than their content.

    

- **How Passing an Argument into a Function may or may not Permanently Change the Value that a Variable Contains or Points to**

  - Search (objects in notes.md)

  - Parameters are the names assigned to a function's arguments; arguments are the values that get passed to the function.

  - Variables are not passed to or returned by functions: **values** or **references** are passed.

  - <u>Mutation (only for objects):</u> Methods and functions can mutate

    -  When a method permanently mutates the object that invokes the method 
    -  Does not preserve the previous value of the object
    -  Change the value of the thing that is bound to the variable 
    -  Changes the value that is actually stored in the memory that the name  refers to
    -  After mutating the value assigned to a variable, the variable continues to refer to the same place in memory.

  - <u>Non- mutating functions</u>

    - ```js
      function addToArray(array) {
        return array.concat(10);
      }
      
      let oneToFive = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      console.log(addToArray(oneToFive)); // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]
      console.log(oneToFive);             // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      ```

    - Makes a copy and mutates that copy

  - <u>Reassignment</u> 

    - Parameters are the names assigned to a function's arguments; arguments are the values that get passed to the function.

    - Variables are not passed to or returned by functions: **values** or **references** are passed.

    - Change what value is assigned or bound to a variable 

    - Makes that name (variable) refer to a completely different place in memory 

    - Changing the *binding* of a variable - that is, the value that is *bound* to the variable

    - ```js
      let num = 3;              // A variable assigned to a primitive value
      let arr = [1, 2, 3];      // A variable assigned to an array
      let obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }; // A variable assigned to an object
      
      num = 42;    // Reassignment
      arr[1] = 42; // Reassignment of array element, but NOT the variable
                   // The array referenced by arr is mutated!
      obj.a = 42;  // Reassignment of object property, but NOT the variable
                   // The object referenced by obj is mutated.
      
      // You can still reassign the variables
      arr = 42;                 // Reassignment; array is lost
      obj = { b: 1, c: 2 }      // Reassignment: now refers to a different object
      ```

  - Truthiness vs Boolean values (see above)

  - Before diving into javascript pass by reference or pass by value functions, it is important to understand the difference between primitives and objects.

  - These are the most basic values one can think of, which includes, undefined, null, boolean, string, and numbers. Primitive values are passed by value in javascript

    Whereas all objects (including functions) are passed by reference in javascript.

    - **Javascript always pass by value** so changing the value of the variable never changes the underlying primitive (String or number).  However, when a variable refers to an object which includes array, the value is the reference to the object.
    - In Pass by Reference, a function is called by directly passing the reference/address of the variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function affects the variable passed from outside the function. In Javascript objects and arrays are passed by reference.
    - In javascript pass by value, the function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as the argument. Therefore, even changing the argument inside the function doesn’t affect the variable passed from outside the function.
    - On comparing both functions, namely javascript pass by reference, pass by value, we can see that ALL objects interact by reference in Javascript, so when setting equal to each other or passing to a function they all point to the same location so when you change one object you change them all. This is a stark difference compared to pass by value, wherein the pass by value function copies the value into two separate spots in memory effectively making them entirely separate entities despite one initially being set equal to the other.

- **Working with Strings, Arrays, and Objects. In particular, you  should be thoroughly familiar with the basic Array iteration methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `find`) and how to use Object methods to access the keys and values in an Object as an Array.**

  

  - An array property with a key of anything other than a non-negative integer is not counted as part of the array's `length`. 

  - JavaScript arrays have several methods that iterate over the elements:

  - (element, index, array) you can access the array and the element

  - **Callback function** (solid)

    -  A callback function is a function that you can pass to another function as an argument.  During iterative methods, the callback function is invoked with each element's value being passed as an argument one at a time. 

    -----------

    

"ARRAY LOOPING ABSTRACTIONS" DO NOT ITERATE OVER NON ELEMENTS

 - `forEach` method:

   - ```js
     let names = ['Chris', 'Kevin', 'Naveed', 'Pete', 'Victor'];
     
     names.forEach(function(name) {
       console.log(name);
     });
     ```
     
   - To use `forEach`, you n2eed a **callback** function that you pass to `forEach` as an argument. The called function invokes the callback function when it runs. The `forEach` method invokes its callback once for each element, passing it the element's value as an argument. `forEach` always returns undefined.
   

 - `map` method:

   - ```js
     > let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
     > let squares = numbers.map(num => num * num);
     > squares
     = [ 1, 4, 9, 16 ]
     
     > squares = numbers.map(num => num * num);
     = [ 1, 4, 9, 16 ]
     ```

   - Map is an iterative function that returns a new transformed array. The length of the array remains intact, but the new elements' value at that index is dependant on the return from the callback function with the original element at that index's value passed in as an argument. Map works similarly to `forEach` in that it iterates through an array, invoking a callback method once for each element of the array.  The difference is that map returns a tranformed array, while `forEach` returns `undefined`.

- `filter`

  - ```js
    > let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2]
    > numbers.filter(num => num > 4)
    = [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]
    
    > numbers
    = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2 ]
    ```

  - The `filter` method is another array iteration method. It  returns a new array that includes all elements from the calling array  for which the callback returns a truthy value.

  - During each iteration, it invokes the callback function, using the value of the current element as an argument. If the callback returns a truthy value, `filter` appends the element's value to a new array. Otherwise, it ignores the element's value and does nothing

  - it returns the array of *selected* elements: the elements for which the callback returned a truthy value- doesn't mutate the caller 

- `find`

  - The `find()` method is an [iterative method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#iterative_methods). It calls a provided `callbackFn`function once for each element in an array in ascending-index order, until `callbackFn` returns a [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) value. `find()` then returns that element and stops iterating through the array. If `callbackFn` never returns a truthy value, `find()`returns [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined).

  - returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the providing testing function

  - if no value satifies the testing function `undefined` is returned 

  - A function to execute for each element in the array. It should return a [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy)value to indicate a matching element has been found, and a [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) value otherwise. The function is called with the following arguments:

  - ```js
    const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];
    
    const found = array1.find((element) => element > 10);
    
    console.log(found);
    // Expected output: 12
    ```

    







-  **Understand that arrays are objects, and be able to determine whether you have an Array** (See `array elements change` in notes.md)
  
  - ```js
    > let arr = [1, 2, 3]
    > typeof arr
    = 'object'
    
    > let arr = [1, 2, 3]
    > Array.isArray(arr)
    = true
    ```
  
    SOLID 
  
    Arrays are data types in JavaScript that can store a collection of data.  They are implemented with objects, and the elements of an array have non- negative indexes as their respective keys.  Arrays also have a length property (always one more than the highest index), that is used for many of Array object's iterative methods.  Non-array objects do not have this length property.  While you can add non- index keys to an array, they will be properties of the array object. It is important to note that the length property does not recognize these properties as elements, therefor iterative methods on the array do not iterate over these properties. Instead, you must use static Object method's (`Object.keys()`or `Object.values()`) to access and iterate over these properties. You can also use a `for...in` statement to iterate over all the keys in an array, but a `for...of` statement will actually give you the entire non-element property value as a string, which is generally not what you want. It is best to use an array when you require a data structure that is ordered and indexed, and values do not have associated keys other than numbers. Otherwise, using an Object to store key: value pairs is a better option.
  
    -----
  
    
  
  - The `length` property can be explicitly set (recall that arrays are zero-indexed). Setting the `length` to a value that is less than the current `length` truncates the array; re-setting the `length` to a higher value does not bring back the truncated elements. Setting the `length` to a value greater than the current `length` creates 'empty slots' (sparce arrays) in the array, but the number of actual elements does not increase.
  
  - Accessing these elements by index value returns `undefined`, but certain operations like `Array.prototype.forEach` ignore those missing elements. That leads to the question of whether  the missing elements are really part of the array. We can think about  this array as either a 3-element array whose values are missing, or as  an empty array whose length is 3. Which you choose depends on the  context.
  
  - For most purposes, the elements of a JavaScript array are accessed by an index value, a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...). However, arrays are also objects, which means they can have properties whose name is not a  non-negative integer. For instance, it is possible to define a property  whose key is `"-1"` or `"foo"` on an array, and you can access its value using an index-like syntax: `array[-1]` or `array["foo"]`. As with missing elements, that raises the question of whether these  properties are, in fact, array elements. Again, the answer is  context-dependent. There may be times, for instance, when you want to  treat the `-1` and `"foo"` (but maybe not both) properties as elements, but often you won't.
  



- **[variables as pointers](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/more_stuff#variablesaspointers)** (SOLID)

  

  Variables point to, or reference, a spot in memory that holds something.  This can be the value itself in the case of primitives, or another pointer if the variable is assigned to an object.

  When a variable is declared in Javascript, it allocates a space in memory to hold something.  If the variable is initialized to a primitive, the actual value will be stored in this space and the variable will point to it. When a primitive is reassigned, it will simply store the new value in this same location.  

  Because primitives are immutable, a new value will always be returned if there is some operation performed on the value. 

  When a primitive value is passed in as an argument or a variable is simply assigned to another variable, it acts as pass by value, and a copy of value will be stored in a different memory spot that the new variable points to.  As such, a function can never affect the original value that a variable points to that is passed in as an argument.

  

  "The main underlying concept is the the way in which variables, including function parameters, act as pointers. "!!!!! use when things are not mutated

  --------

  

  - **Primitive**

    - **Pass by Value**

      - The concept of "pass-by-value" traditionally means that when you use a variable to pass an argument to a function, the function can't do anything that sets the original variable to a different value. No matter what happens in the function, the variable will still contain the same value that was passed to the function.  

        The main underlying concept is the the way in which variables, including function parameters, act as pointers. 

      - ```js
        let word = 'Hello';
        
        function myFunc(param) {
          param = 'Goodbye';
        }
        
        myFunc(word);
        console.log(word); // 'Hello'
        ```

    - | Code        | address `a` | `a`  | address `b` | `b`  |
      | :---------- | :---------: | :--: | :---------: | :--: |
      | `let a = 5` |   `0x14`    | `5`  |             |      |
      | `let b = a` |   `0x14`    | `5`  |   `0x76`    | `5`  |
      | `a = 8`     |   `0x14`    | `8`  |   `0x76`    | `5`  |

    

  - **Objects**

    - In this example, the variable `obj` is always at address `0x1234`. The value at that address is a pointer to the actual object. While the  pointer to the object can change -- we can see it change when `{ b: 2 }` is reassigned to `obj` -- `obj` itself always has the same address. 
    - Objects include, but aren't limited to, the following types:

      -   Simple Objects

      -   Arrays

      -   Dates

      -   Functions

    - | Code             | Address `c` -> pointer(value) -> referenced object | addr `d` -> pointer -> object |
       | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
       | `let c = [1, 2]` |            `0x28` -> `0x34` -> `[1, 2]`            |                               |
       | `let d = c`      |            `0x28` -> `0x34` -> `[1, 2]`            | `0x68` -> `0x34` -> `[1, 2]`  |
       | `c = [3, 4]`     |            `0x28` -> `0x24` -> `[3, 4]`            | `0x68` -> `0x34` -> `[1, 2]`  |

    - ```javascript
      let array1 = [2, 6, 4];
      let array2 = [2, 6, 4];
      
      console.log(array1 === array2);  //false
      
      let array1 = [2, 6, 4];
      let array2 = array1;
      
      console.log(array1 === array2); // true
      ```

      Primitives, like strings or numbers, are compared by their value. Arrays, however, are objects and not primitives. JavaScript compares whether two objects are strictly equal by checking whether they are the *same object*, i.e. whether they reference the same location in memory. Since we constructed two array objects, one on line 1 and one on line 2, they don't have the same reference.

      **PASS by REFERENCE EXAMPLE**

      - ```js
        function changeMyWords(words) {
          console.log(words);
          words[0] = 'Hi';
        }
        
        let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
        changeMyWords(myWords);
        console.log(myWords);
        ```

        - This will log `['Hello', 'Goodbye']` and then `['Hi', 'Goodbye']` to the console.

          In this exercise, the `myWords` variable is initialized to an array containing two elements, the strings `'Hello'`and `'Goodbye'`. Because an array is a reference type rather than a primitive, when we pass `myWords` into the `changeMyWords` function invocation, this acts like *pass-by-reference*. The `myWords` variable and the `words`function parameter both point to the *same* array. When we initially log `words` on line 2 we see the same array elements from the array literal to which we initialized `myWords`. We then mutate the array on line 3 by assigning index `0` to the string `'Hi'`. When we subsequently log `myWords` on line 8, we see the mutated array.

      

      **Shallow Copy**

  - As you might expect, the values for the `number` and `string` keys changed in `objCopy`, but not in `obj`. However, when we mutated the value of `objCopy.array`, it also mutated that value of `obj.array`. That's because a shallow copy only copies pointers for nested objects; since arrays are objects, the shallow copy just copied the pointer to the original array to `objCopy`. If you're wondering why this happens, you might want to review [Variables as Pointers](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/more_stuff#variablesaspointers) section in the Introduction to JavaScript book.

- **console.log vs return**

  -  **console.** **log is function that logs passed in argument to console.** **return is keyword, which part of the return statement, used to end function execution**. Once line with it is executed, the function is exited and function returns whatever is defined in the return statement.
  -  In Node, that is your screen; in your browser, it's the Console in your Developer Tools application. The term **log** is a synonym for printing or displaying something on the console.

- **truthiness: `false` and `true` vs. falsy and truthy**

  -  There are 8 falsy values in Javascript.  What does that mean? These values evaluate to false when used in a Boolean context
     - `false`    
     - `null`        You can use boolean function on these`Boolean(null)` //false
     - `undefined`. You can use double ! operator to coerce a truthy or falsy into a value's boolean equivalent  `!!(undefined)` // false
     - `0`
     - `NaN`
     - `''` or `""`
     - `-0` (negative zero)
     - `0n` (BigInt zero)

  - You can combine boolean and non-boolean values with logical operators `! (logical not),||,&&` or compare with comparison operators `==,===,>,<`

  - Search **comparison rules**

    

  -  Note that saying that a value evaluates to true or false is **not** the same as saying that those values **are** `true` or `false`, or that they are **equal to** `true` or `false`. These may seem like subtle distinctions, but they are important ones.
  -  Use "evaluates to true" or "is truthy" when discussing expressions that only have to be truthy.
  -  Use "evaluates to false" or "is falsy" when discussing expressions that only have to be falsy.
  -  Do not use "is `true`" or "is equal to `true`" unless you are specifically discussing the boolean value `true`.
  -  Do not use "is `false`" or "is equal to `false`" unless you are specifically discussing the boolean value `false`.

- **Function definition and function invocation**

  | If you are...           | Then you should use... |
  | :---------------------- | :--------------------- |
  | **Defining** a function | *parameters*           |
  | **Invoking** a function | *arguments*            |

  

  - ```javascriptfunction greet(greeting = 'Hello') {
    function greet(greeting = 'Hello') {
      console.log(greeting + ', world!');
    }
    ```

    Default parameters are a great way to assign a default value to a parameter. This default value is used in case the parameter is `undefined`, which is the case if `greet` is called without an argument.

- **function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions**

  - (my words)

    A function is executable code that can be called repeatedly throughout the program. Functions perform a task, and require invocation. They allow for more reuasable, maintainable, and organized code. Future changes to that code only require change in a single location.  Functions often return useful values which you can capture with variables and use elsewhere.

    (DECLARATION)

    Function declarations, or function statements, use the `function` keyword, the name of the function (required in a declaration), optional parameters, and a block of statements.  The declaration creates a functional variable with the same name as the function that has a value of  the function itself, and therefor is of the type `function`.  

    -------

    EXPRESSION - *<u>NOT MY WORDS</u>- Our example declares a variable named `greetPeople` and  assigns it to the function expression after the `=` sign. We can do that since JavaScript functions are **first-class functions***

    ----

    (EXPRESSION) 

    A function expression does not begin with the keyword `function` and is typically assigned to a variable. You can either have an anonymous function expression or a named function expression, but that name will only be availble within the function as a local variable.  Named expressions are helpful for debugging and recursive functions. Both named and anonymous function expressions can be assigned to variables. It is not hoisted like a function declaration, and so cannot be used prior to it appearing in the program.

    *"anonymous function assigned to `foo` returns.."*

    (ARROW)

    An arrow function expression gives us a shorthand for writing a tradional function expressions.  They are always anonymous, but they can be assigned to a variable. We see them most often as callback functions. You can omit the `function` keyword, and also the `{}` and `return` keyword if the body contains a single expression.  After the parameters the arrow syntax,  `=>`, is used followed by the body. Again, because it is not a function declaration, it behaves as a typical function expression as far as hoisting is concerned. 

    (PARAMS/ ARGUMENTS/ RETURN)

    The parameters declare local variables for the function, and are initialized to the values of the corresponding arguments passed into the function upon invocation.  This allows for the function to have access to data that may be out of scope, or to simply have local variables in the function assigned to the appropriate values upon invocation.  If there is a missing argument, the local variable with the parameter name is initialized to `undefined`.  Functions implicitly return `undefined` unless there is an explicit `return` statement in the function.   A return statement can be anywhere within the function, and when encountered JavaScript evaluates the expression, terminates the function, and returns the value. 

    To invoke a function we must append `()` to the function name, or we will just return the function object. 

    --------

    (see `[Function: foo]` in notes.md for examples)

    <u>NOT MY WORDS</u>

  - During execution, JavaScript makes the arguments passed to a function available to the function as local variables with the same names as the function's parameters. Within the function body, these local variables are called arguments

    Function names are just local variables, so you can assign it to a new local variable and call the function using a new name 

    - The difference between functions and other variables is that the  function has to be run in order to determine its value. When you need to access that value in multiple places in your code, it is more efficient to run the function once and assign the value returned to a variable.  That variable is used in the rest of the calculations.
    - You can say "the blank function call returns"

    - search in notes.md
      - 1) `Default Parameter`
        2) `Nested Method`

  - <u>*Arrow Function*</u>

    - ```js
      const multiply = (a, b) => {
        return a * b;
      };
      
      const multiply = (a, b) => return a * b;
      
      const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
      ```

    - Arrow functions are most often used as **callback functions**

      - ```js
        [1, 2, 3].map((element) => 2 * element); // returns [2, 4, 6]
        ```

  

  

  

- **first-class functions** (SOLID)

  JavaScript functions are first- class functions, which means that they are treated like any other variable. Functions are actually objects that can be assigned to a variable or element, passed as an argument to a function, and even returned by another function.  

  The declaration of a function actually creates a functional variable with the same name as the function that has a value of  the function itself, and therefor is of the type `function`.  

  ----------

  

  - **Callback function**

    -  The function that we pass as an argument to another function is called a *[callback function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function)*. 

  - ```js
    //RETURNING A FUNCTION
    
    function sayHello() {
      return () => {
        console.log("Hello!");
      };
    }
    //In this example, we are returning a function from another function - We can return a function because functions in JavaScript are treated as values.
    
    //A function that returns a function or takes other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function.
    
    
    function one() {
      function log(result) {
        console.log(result);
      }
    
      function anotherOne(...args) {
        let result = '';
        for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i += 1) {
          result += String.fromCharCode(args[i]);
        }
    
        log(result);
      }
    
      function anotherAnotherOne() {
        console.log(String.fromCharCode(87, 101, 108, 99, 111, 109, 101));
        anotherOne(116, 111);
      }
    
      anotherAnotherOne();
      anotherOne(116, 104, 101);
      return anotherOne;
    }
    
    one()(77, 97, 116, 114, 105, 120, 33);
    
    //The trick to solving this problem is to follow the sequence of function calls. The call to the one function may look confusing, but it is actually just two successive function calls (because the one function returns the anotherOne function). Notice that when the anotherOne function is returned, it still has access to the log function that is declared in its enclosing scope (closure) inside the one function.
    ```

  - ```JS
    //PASSING A FUNCTION AS AN ARGUMENT
    
    function sayHello() {  
      return "Hello, ";
    }
    function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
      console.log(helloMessage() + name);
    }
    // Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function
    greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!"); //say hello is a calllback function
    // Hello, JavaScript!
    //We are passing our sayHello() function as an argument to the greeting() function, this explains how we are treating the function as a value.
    ```

  - ```js
    //ASSIGNING A FUNCTION TO A VARIABLE 
    
    const foo = () => {
      console.log("foobar");
    };
    foo(); // Invoke it using the variable
    // foobar
    //We assigned an Anonymous Function in a Variable, then we used that variable to invoke the function by adding parentheses () at the end.
    
    //Note: Even if your function was named, you can use the variable name to invoke it. Naming it will be helpful when debugging your code. But it won't affect the way we invoke it.
    
    
    function foo(bar) {
      console.log(bar, bar, bar);
    }
    
    let bar = foo;
    
    foo("hello"); // prints "hello hello hello"
    bar("hi");    // prints "hi hi hi
    
    //We can actually assign another variable to the function name and call the function by the other variable name 
    ```

  - When you pass a function as an argument to another function, that other  function can call the function represented by the argument. 

  - Just like functions, object literal methods must be *called* by appending parentheses (e.g., `person.firstName()`) in order to be executed. Functions are first-class objects, so referencing the function name without the parentheses would return the function itself, not the string representation:

    

- **partial function application** (SOLID)

  Partial function application is when we have a nested function, and the enclosing function provides some of the nested functions arguments.  When we call the returned function, we supply the remaining arguments if necessary.  To clarify, the first function call will return another function.  This returned function can then be called with less arguments than expected, because these arguments were provided in the initial function call.  These can be especially useful when you know that you won't have the correct number of arguments when calling a function. 

  Partial Function Application uses closures to access those variables available to the nested function during creation. (GO TO CLOSURES)

  -------

  - ```js
    function add(first, second) {
      return first + second;
    }
    
    function makeAdder(firstNumber) {
      return function(secondNumber) {
        return add(firstNumber, secondNumber);
      };
    }
    
    let addFive = makeAdder(5);
    let addTen = makeAdder(10);
    
    console.log(addFive(3));  // 8
    console.log(addFive(55)); // 60
    console.log(addTen(3));   // 13
    console.log(addTen(55));  // 65
    
    
    const add = function(a, b) { // primary 
      return a + b;
    }
    
    
    
    function outer(arg1) { // generator
      return function inner(arg2) { // applicator
        return add(arg1, arg2);
      }
    }
    
    fir = outer(4) // returns another function (applicator)
    fir(3)
    ```

    

  - Partial function application requires a reduction in the **number of arguments** you have to provide when you call a function. If the number of arguments isn't reduced, it isn't partial function application. 

  - A closure is when you combine some state or context with code so that you can execute that code later bound to those state values even when the origin of the values is now gone. **Partial application is when you bind one or more (but not all) arguments of a function to values using a closure**.

  - Partial application starts with a function. We take this function and create a new one with one or more of its arguments already “set” or *partially applied*. It will reduce the number of parameters needed for our functions.

  - Partial application is the act of taking a function which takes multiple arguments, and “locking in” some of those arguments, producing a function which takes fewer arguments. 

  - Partial application is a technique in functional programming that allows you to create a new function with some of the arguments pre-filled. This can be useful when you want to reuse a function with the same arguments multiple times.

    

- **Side Effects**

  - Side effects is **something that makes our function impure by default**. Any asynchronous processes or working with things outside of Javascript are side effects.

  - A function call that performs any of the following actions is said to have side effects:

    1. It reassigns any non-local variable.
    2. It mutates the value of any object referenced by a non-local variable.
    3. It reads from or writes to any data entity (files, network connections, etc.) that is non-local to your program.
    4. It raises an exception.
    5. It calls another function that has side effects.
       - If the function can have side effects when used as intended, then we say the function itself has side effects. In practice, functions that have side effects have them regardless of what arguments are passed in.
         - If a required argument is omitted, the function isn't being used as intended.
         - If you pass an array to a function that expects a number, the function isn't being used as intended.
         - If you call a function before you've done any required preparations (such as opening a connection to a remote server), the function isn't being used as intended.

    

    1. *Side effects from Reassignement*

       1. If the function reassigns any variable that is not declared inside the function, the function has a side effect. 

       2. ```javascript
          let number = 42;
          function incrementNumber() {
            number += 1; // side effect: number is defined in outer scope
          }
          ```

    2. *Side effects through Mutation*

       1. Mutation side effects are similar to reassignment side effects in that they require a variable that is declared outside the function. It's almost as easy to spot as reassignment, but not always. Suppose such a variable exists and references an object or an array. If the function mutates that object or array, then the function has a side effect.

       2. ```javascript
          let letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
          function removeLast() {
            letters.pop(); // side effect: alters the array referenced by letters
          }
          ```

       3. Or passed in as an argument

          1. ```javascript
             let letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
             function removeLast(array) {
               array.pop(); // side effect: alters the array referenced by letters
             }
             
             removeLast(letters);
             ```

       4. *Side effects through Input/Output*

          1. Reading from a file on the system's disk
          2. Writing to a file on the system's disk
          3. Reading input from the keyboard
          4. Writing to the console
             1. A `console.log()` causes a function to have side effects because it affects the state of an external code—that is, the `console` object's state.

          5. Accessing a database
          6. Updating the display on a web page
          7. Reading data from a form on a web page
          8. Sending data to a remote web site
          9. Receiving data from a remote web site
          10. Accessing system hardware such as:
              - The mouse, trackpad, or other pointing devices
              - The clock
              - The random number generator
              - The audio speakers
              - The camera

          ```javascript
          // This code may not work in a browser; use Node instead.
          let readLine = require("readline-sync");
          
          function getName() {
            let name = readLine.question("Enter your name: "); // side effect: output and input
            console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); // side effect: output to console
          }
          
          
          let date = new Date(); // side effect: accesses the system clock
          let rand = Math.random(); // side effect: accessed random number generator
          ```

       5. *Side Effects Through Other Functions* (each of these functions propagates their side effects to the function that called it.)

          - One thing to note is that this type of side effect is only important when the invoked function has side effects that aren't local to the calling function

          - If the side effects can only be seen inside the calling function, then that side effect has no effect on whether the calling function has side effects. Consider this code:

          - ```javascript
            function insertNumberInOrder(arrayOfNumbers) {
              arrayOfNumbers = arrayOfNumbers.slice(); // creates a copy of an array
              arrayOfNumbers.push(arrayOfNumbers); // not a side effect since copy of array
              arrayOfNumbers.sort((a, b) => a - b); // sort has side effects within function
              return arrayOfNumbers; // function has no side effect
            }
            ```

            

          1. Suppose a function invokes another function, and that invoked function has a side effect that is visible outside of the calling function. In that case, the calling function also has a side effect.
          2. `console.log` has a side effect.
          3. `readline.question` has multiple side effects.
          4. `new Date()` has a side effect (it accesses the system clock).
          5. `Math.random()` has a side effect (it accesses the random number generator).

       - **MIXING SIDE EFFECTS AND RETURN VALUES**
         - most functions should return a useful value or they should have a side effect, but not both
         - By *useful value*, we mean that the function returns a value that has meaning to the calling code. For instance, a `sum` function should probably return a number that contains the result of adding some numbers together. A function that returns an arbitrary value or that always returns the same value is not returning a useful value.

    - **Pure Functions**
      - Have no side effects.- easy to test/isolate
      - As with side effects, it's common to speak of functions as being pure or impure. However, it's more correct to talk about whether a specific function **call** is pure or impure
      - Given the same set of arguments, the function always returns the same value during the function's lifetime. This rule implies that the return value of a pure function depends solely on its arguments.
      - If we execute `square(42)` one billion times, it will return the same value each time: `1764`. It returns a consistent result no matter what value we pass to it:
      - The consistent return value is possibly the most important feature of pure functions. The fact that the return value is dependent solely on the arguments implies that **nothing else in the program can influence the function during the function's lifetime**. A function's **lifetime** begins when the function is created. It ends when the function is destroyed.
        - Nested functions, for instance, have a lifetime that spans a single execution of the outer function. Furthermore, nested functions are created every time the outer function is invoked. Each instantiation of the nested function is separate. Even if the function looks identical, it can produce different results for each instantiation -- that does not change its status as a pure function.

    ```javascript
    const square = value => value * value;
    ```

    - A Pure Function is **a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed**. It does not depend on any state or data change during a program's execution. Rather, it only depends on its input arguments.

    - ```js
      let currentTotal;
      // lots of code omitted
      
      function addToTotal(a) {
        return currentTotal + a;
      }
      
      // lots of code omitted
      ```

    - It is not a pure function since it relies on a variable that isn't scoped locally to the function (`currentTotal`). Thus, even when called with the same argument as a previous invocation, the function may not return the same value.

    - Becomes a non-deterministic function

      Using external code in `addNumber()` makes it a non-deterministic function—as you can never determine its output by solely reading it.

      In other words, to be sure of `addNumber()`'s return value, you must consider other external factors—such as the current state of `oldDigit`.

      Therefore, `addNumber()` is not independent—it always has strings attached.

- **naming conventions (legal vs idiomatic)**

  - See *stylistic tips* in notes

    

- **Strict Mode vs. Sloppy Mode**

  - (Use of ESLint as a static code analyzer for JS)

  - JavaScript ES5 introduced **strict mode**, which is an optional mode that modifies the semantics of JavaScript and prevents certain kinds of errors and syntax.

    

  - What is strict mode? How does it differ from sloppy mode?

  - - Strict mode eliminates some **silent errors** that occur in sloppy mode by changing them to throw errors instead. Silent errors occur when a program does something that is unintended, but continues to run as though nothing is wrong. This can lead to incorrect results or errors much later in execution that are subsequently difficult to track down.
      - Strict mode prevents some code that can inhibit JavaScript's ability to optimize a program so that it runs faster.
      - Strict mode prohibits using names and syntax that may conflict with future versions of JavaScript.
      - Several benefits to programmers:	
        - They prevent or mitigate bugs.
        - They help make debugging easier.
        - They help your code run faster. (expedite)
        - They help you avoid conflicts with future changes to the language.

    

    

    - How do you enable strict mode at the global or function level?

      - Strict mode is easy to turn on either at the global level of a program or at the individual function level. 

      - Note also that nested functions inherit strict mode from the surrounding scope.

      - The `"use strict"` statement is an example of a **pragma**, a language construct that tells a compiler, interpreter, or other translator to process the code in a different way. Pragmas aren't part of the language, and often use odd syntax like `"use strict"` does.

      - Once you enable strict mode, **you can't disable it later** in the same program or function.

      - You must specify the `"use strict"` pragma at the very beginning of the file or function. You can't enable it partway through a program or function:

      - ```javascript
        //global strict mode
        
        "use strict";
        
        // The rest of the program. Everything from here to the end of
        // the file runs in strict mode.
        
        function foo() {
          // strict mode is enabled here too.
        }
        
        // Strict mode is still enabled
        foo();
        ```

      - ```javascript
        //function strict mode
        
        function foo() {
          'use strict';
        
          // The rest of the function. Everything from here to the end of
          // the function runs in strict mode.
        }
        
        // Strict mode is disabled unless you defined it globally.
        foo();
        ```

        - Strict mode is lexically scoped; that is, it only applies to the code that enables it. For instance:

        - ```javascript
          function foo() {
            "use strict";
            // All code here runs in strict mode
          }
          
          function bar() {
            // All code here runs in sloppy mode
            foo(); // This invocation is sloppy mode, but `foo` runs in strict mode
            // All code here runs in sloppy mode
          }
          
          function foo() {
            // All code here runs in sloppy mode
          }
          
          function bar() {
            "use strict";
            // All code here runs in strict mode
            foo(); // This invocation is strict mode, but `foo` runs in sloppy mode
            // All code here runs in strict mode
          }
          ```

          

    

    

    - Describe how code behaves under both strict and sloppy mode.

      - It won't let you create variables without explicitly declaring them first 

      - ```javascript
        "use strict";
        
        function foo() {
          bar = 3.1415; // ReferenceError: bar is not defined
        }
        
        foo();
        console.log(bar);
        
        //you have to actually define it as a global variable 
        
        "use strict";
        
        let bar;
        
        function foo() {
          bar = 3.1415;
        }
        
        foo();
        console.log(bar); // 3.1415
        ```

      - Help identify misspelled names -  If you declare a variable with one name, then later try to reassign it with a misspelled name, sloppy mode will create a new global variable. Consider this code:

      - ```javascript
        let aVariableWithALongName = 2.71828;
        
        // a bunch of omitted code here
        
        aVariab1eWithALongName = 3.14159;
        console.log(aVariableWithALongName); // 2.71828; should be 3.14159
        
        // line 5 creates a global variable instead of reassigning the variable as intended. 
        
        "use strict";
        
        let aVariableWithALongName = 2.71828;
        
        // a bunch of omitted code here
        
        aVariab1eWithALongName = 3.14159; // ReferenceError: aVariab1eWithALongName is not defined
        console.log(aVariableWithALongName);
        ```

        

    

    - When is strict mode enabled automatically?

      - JavaScript enables strict mode automatically within the body of a `class`; there is no way to prevent that behavior. The same thing happens with JavaScript modules, which we'll discuss in a later assignment.

      

    - When should you use (or not use) strict mode?

    - Use strict mode in any new code that you write. If you're adding new functions to an old codebase, it's safe to use function-level strict mode in the new functions, and you probably should do so. However, if you're not creating a new function in that old codebase, you probably shouldn't try to use strict mode. The changes in semantics, particularly those having to do with variable declarations, `this`, and silent failures, can easily break code that otherwise works well.

  

- **JavaScript syntactic sugar**















to do: 

`for (let;;)`

iteration `forEach, map, find, filter`







<u>**Code Example Explanations**</u>

Loops: Looping keyword, condition, block (loop body)

1) **do...while loop**

   1) ```javascript
      let counter = 0;
      
      do {
        console.log('Woooot!');
        counter -= 1;
      } while (counter > 0);
      ```

      Both statements execute the given block as long as the condition evaluates to true. The difference is that the condition in a `while statement` is checked **before** executing the block, while the condition in a `do...while` statement is checked **after** the block has been executed. So the block in a `do...while` statement will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is not satisfied. See **while loop**  to add anything

      

2) **while loop**

   1) ```javascript
      let array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      let index = 0;
      
      while (index < array.length) {
        console.log(array[index]);
        index += 1;
      }
      ```

      On line 5, we access the array element at the current index, and pass that value as an argument to the `console.log` method, which logs it to the console. Subsequently, we increment `index` by 1.

      We use the `while` keyword with a conditional expression and a block. The block is defined on lines 4-7.   Javascript evaluates the conditional expression and if it evaluates to true then the block is executed. After each block iteration, the conditional is re-evaluated. The loop terminates if the condition has a falsy value.  Since JavaScript arrays have a zero-based index, we want to terminate the loop when `index` is equal to `array.length`, because the last index of an array is always *one less* than the array's length.  The loop block *must* modify `index` in some way that ultimately makes the loop condition `false`. If it doesn't, the loop becomes an infinite loop.

      This example demonstrates variable scoping rules:

      Note that we declare the variables `array` and `index` with the `let` keyword outside of a block.  Therefor these variables are visible in the Global scope, which is why they are accessible within the `while` loop.  If they were declared inside the block, then they would have block scope, and would be inaccessible outside of the block.  

      

3) **`continue` statement**

   1) ```javascript
      let cities = ['Istanbul', 'Los Angeles', 'Tokyo', null, 'Vienna', null, 'London', 'Beijing', null];
      
      for (let i = 0; i < cities.length; i += 1) {
        if (cities[i] === null) {
          continue;
        }
      
        console.log(cities[i].length);
      }
      ```

      `continue` terminates the current iteration and continues with execution of the next iteration. This allows us to skip each element that is equal to `null`.  

      The `break` statement "jumps out" or terminate a loop.

      The `continue` statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.

      - keywords `continue` and `break`to provide more control over loops 

      1. `continue`

         1. lets you start a new iteration of the loop

         2. When a loop encounters the `continue` keyword, it skips running the rest of the block and jumps ahead to the next iteration

         3. You can rewrite a loop that uses `continue` with a negated `if` conditional.

            

4) **`if/ else if/ else` statement**

   1) ```javascript
      if (condition1) {
        //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
      } else if (condition2) {
        //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
      } else {
        //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
      }
      ```

      Conditional statements are sets of commands that are triggered when a  condition is true. In JavaScript, there are two conditional statements  supported: `if…else` and `switch`.

      Often use comparison and logical operators: (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `&&`, `||`) to direct traffic.

      Use the `if` statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.

       	 `if (x ===3)`is a conditional statement 
    	
       	 `(x==3)` is the single `condition`/expression that evaluates to a boolean

      ​          The text that executes when the conditional statement is true is the `clause`

      ​	  `{console.log("x is 3")};` is a block.

      Use the `else if` statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

      Use the `else` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

      ex/ The condition provided to our `if` statement uses the *logical or* operator `||`. Therefore the condition will evaluate to a truthy value if *either one* of its operands is truthy. Since `true` is truthy, the condition will always be truthy as well.

      

5) **Ternary Operator - if-then-else statwment**

   1) ```javascript
      condition ? expression1 : expression2
      ```

      The **ternary operator** is a quick and easy way to write a short, concise, and simple if/else conditional. It uses a combination of the `?` and `:` symbols and takes 3 operands (hence, the name "ternary"):

      The chief advantage that the ternary operator has over an `if/else` statement is that the entire structure is an expression. What that  means is that we can treat the ternary expression as a value: we can  assign it to a variable, pass it as an argument, and so on. Since `if/else` is a statement, we can't capture its result to a variable.

      If the condition provided is truthy, `expression1` will be evaluated. If the condition is falsy, `expression2` will be evaluated.

      Ternary expressions should usually be used to select between 2 values,  not to choose between two actions. (An action would be something like  logging a value to the console or setting a variable to a new value.)  

      *The ternary expression's result should almost always be*

      1. Assigned to a  variable

      2. Passed to a function as an argument

      3. Returned by a  function. 

         - If you're not doing one of those things, an `if/else` statement is a better choice.

           

6) **`switch` statement**

   1) ```javascript
      let animal = 'horse';
      
      switch (animal) {
        case 'duck':
          console.log('quack');
        case 'squirrel':
          console.log('nook nook');
        case 'horse':
          console.log('neigh');
        case 'bird':
          console.log('tweet tweet');
        default:
          console.log('*cricket*');
      }
      ```

      Conditional statements are sets of commands that are triggered when a  condition is true. In JavaScript, there are two conditional statements  supported: `if…else` and `switch`.

      The switch statement works by comparing an expression given to it with the expressions in each case clause using the strict comparison (`===`).

      The `switch` statement evaluates the provided expression (`animal` in our case) and will execute the statement associated with the case that matches, *as well as the statements in all cases following the matching case* until reaching either the end of the `switch` statement or a `break`.  If the value of the provided expression does not match any `case` clause, the `default` clause is executed. If we use `return` we don't need to use `break` bc it will immediately exit the function anyways.

      In the provided code, this means that after finding a matching case (`'horse'`), JavaScript will execute `console.log('neigh')` as well as the `console.log` invocations in all following clauses.

      In order to avoid this "fall through" behavior, we can place a `break` statement in each clause of our `switch` statement, as seen below: 

      ```javascript
      let animal = 'horse';
      
      switch (animal) {
        case 'duck':
          console.log('quack');
          break;
        case 'horse':
          console.log('neigh');
          break;
        case 'bird':
          console.log('tweet tweet');
          break;
        default:
          console.log('*crickets*');
      }
      ```

7. ```js
   let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const myOtherArray = myArray;
   
   myArray.pop();
   console.log(myArray);
   console.log(myOtherArray);
   
   myArray = [1, 2];
   console.log(myArray);
   console.log(myOtherArray);
   ```

   **Reassignment vs mutation**

    The value of the reference gets copied. 

   (One of the fundamental differences of objects versus primitives is that objects are stored and copied “by reference”, whereas primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc – are always copied “as a whole value”.)

   **A variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its “address in memory” – in other words “a reference” to it. When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.**

   The value logged for `myOtherArray` at line 6 is identical to the value logged on line 5 for `myArray`. This is because both `myArray`and `myOtherArray` reference the same array in memory. If you mutate the array with `myArray`, you'll see the effects of that mutation with either `myArray` and `myOtherArray`. Therefore, when we pop a value from `myArray` on line 4, we see the effect of the change in both `myArray` and `myOtherArray`.

   On line 8, however, we reassign `myArray` to a new array, `[1, 2]`. Reassignments of variables never mutate the value or object that was originally referenced by that variable. Instead, reassignment creates a completely new value or object, and changes the variable so it references that new item. The reassignment, however, **does not change** any other variable that may be referencing the original item - the other variables still reference the old item. Thus, on lines 9, we see that the array referenced by `myArray` is now `[1, 2]`, but the array referenced by `myOtherArray` on line 10 still refers to `[1, 2, 3]`.

8) `For Loop` (Keep declaration and initalization in loop)

   1) ```js
      let names = ['Chris', 'Kevin', 'Naveed', 'Pete', 'Victor'];
      let upperNames = [];
      
      for (let index = 0; index < names.length; index += 1) {
        let upperCaseName = names[index].toUpperCase();
        upperNames.push(upperCaseName);
      }
      
      console.log(upperNames); // => ['CHRIS', 'KEVIN', 'NAVEED', 'PETE', 'VICTOR']
      ```

   2) Execute the initialization statement. Note that the statement may include variable declarations.

   3. Evaluate the condition. The loop terminates if the condition has a falsy value.

   4. Execute the body of the loop.

   5. Execute the increment expression.

   6. Return to step 2 for the next iteration.

   - `for` loops let you see and understand the looping logic at a single glance. The syntax also lets you move the `index` variable from the global scope into the scope of the `for` statement, and it helps make your code cleaner and more organized.
   - Same purpose at `while` loop with a condensed syntax that works well when iterating over arrays and other sequences 
   - A `for` loop combines variable initialization, a loop condition, and the variable increment/decrement expression all on the same line:
   - All 3 components of the `for` loop are optional
   - for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) {  statement }
     - A good way to write this:
       - In our solution code, we initialize `i` to 10, and decrement `i` by 1 on each iteration, using the short-hand expression `i -= 1`. Once `i` is equal to 0, the condition provided to our `for` loop is false and the loop terminates. Finally, we log `'Launch!'`.







**Comparison Rules**

- Using logical operators 

```javascript
true || true;    // true
true || false;   // true
false || true;   // true
false || false;  // false
false || [];     // [] (second operand is non-boolean, it is returned as is)

//! returns true if its operand is falsey. false otherwise 
//! is a unary operator(takes only one operand)\
!true;   // false
!false;  // true
!!true;  // true
!1;      // false
![];     // false
```

- NaN

```javascript
> value === NaN         
= false   //`NaN` is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself:

> NaN === NaN
= false

INSTEAD USE:

> let value = NaN;
> Number.isNaN(value)
= true

> Object.is(value, NaN)
= true
```

- Boolean

```javascript
There is no direct coercion of strings to booleans.
> true === 'true'
false
> true == 'true'
false
let a = 'true';
let b = 'false';
a === 'true';            // true
b === 'true';            // false
false == 0     // false is coerced to the number 0, so the result is true
```

**Comparison Operators**

- Return a boolean value (true or false)
- Compares its operands and returns a boolean value (true or false)
- When the operands are of different types, JavaScript tries to implicitly convert them to suitable types (implicit conversion) unless using `===`
  - The expressions or values that an operator uses are its **operands**. In comparisons, the expressions to the left and right of the operator are the operands. For instance, the equality comparison `x === y` uses the `===` operator with two operands: `x` and `y`.
- **===**
  - Strict equality operator, or identity operator 
  - the two operands are only equal if they are both the same type and have the same value:
  - Equivalent to Ruby's `.equal?`
  - Different than Ruby because strings are equal, not just numbers... you can also see this because strings are immutable (primitive values include strings, numbers, and booleans)

```javascript
> 5 === 5
= true

> 5 === 4
= false

> 'abc' === 'abc'
= true

> 'abc' === 'abcd'
= false

> 'abc' === 'aBc'
= false

> '5' === '5'
= true

> '5' === '6'
= false

> 5 === '5'
= false

> '' === 0
= false
```



- **!==**
  - Strict InEquality Operator returns false when the operands have the same type and value, true otherwise 
- **==**
  - Non-strict equality operator, or loose equality operator 
  - However, when the operands have different types, `==`  attempts to coerce one of the operands to the other operand's type  before it compares them, and it may coerce both operands in some cases.

```javascript
When one operand is a string and the other is a number, the string is converted to a number:

'42' == 42            // true
42 == '42'            // true
42 == 'a'             // false -- becomes 42 == NaN
0 == ''               // true -- becomes 0 == 0
0 == '\n'             // true -- becomes 0 == 0

When one operand is a boolean, it is converted to a number:

42 == true            // false -- becomes 42 == 1
0 == false            // true -- becomes 0 == 0
'0' == false          // true -- becomes '0' == 0, then 0 == 0 (two conversions)
'' == false           // true -- becomes '' == 0, then 0 == 0
true == '1'           // true
true == 'true'        // false -- becomes 1 == 'true', then 1 == NaN


When one operand is null and the other is undefined, the non-strict operator always returns true. If both operands are null or both are undefined, the return value is true. Comparing null or undefined to all other values returns false:

null == undefined      // true
undefined == null      // true
null == null           // true
undefined == undefined // true
undefined == false     // false
null == false          // false
undefined == ''        // false
undefined === null     // false -- strict comparison

[] == '0';               // false -- becomes '' == '0'
[] == 0;                 // true -- becomes '' == 0, then 0 == 0
[] == false;             // true -- becomes '' == false, then 0 == 0
[] == ![];               // true -- same as above
[null] == '';            // true -- becomes '' == ''
[undefined] == false;    // true -- becomes '' == false, then false == false
[false] == false;        // false -- becomes 'false' == 0, then NaN == 0

When one of the operands is NaN, the comparison always returns false:

NaN == 0              // false
NaN == NaN            // false
NaN === NaN           // false -- even with the strict operator
NaN != NaN            // true -- NaN is the only JavaScript value not equal to itself
```

  - **!=**

    - Non-strict inequality Operator, or loose inequality operator 

    - `!=` attempts to coerce one of the operands to the other  operand's type before it compares them, and it may coerce both operands  in some cases. The result is `false` when the final values are the same, `true` otherwise.

    - ```javascript
      // Compare with the `==` and `!==` examples.
      
      > 5 != 5
      = false
      
      > 5 != 4
      = true
      
      > 5 != '5'
      = false
      
      > '' != 0
      = false
      ```

      

- **<**

  - Less than operator returns true when the value of the left operand has a value that is less than the value of the right operand 

  - It'll coerce numbers into strings - character-by-character. JavaScript moves from left-to-right in the  strings looking for the first character that is different from its  counterpart in the other string. Once it finds a character that differs, it compares that character with its counterpart, and makes a decision  based on that. 

  - ```javascript
    > 4 < 5
    = true
    
    > 5 < 4
    = false
    
    > 5 < 5
    = false
    
    > "4" < "5"
    = true
    
    > "42" < "402"
    = false
    
    > "42" < "420"
    = true
    
    > "42" < 420
    = true
    
    The relational operators, <, >, <=, and >= are defined for numbers (numeric comparison) and strings (lexicographic order). There are no strict versions of these operators. When both operands are strings, JavaScript compares them lexicographically. Otherwise, JavaScript converts both operands to numbers before comparing them.
    
    11 > '9'              // true -- '9' is coerced to 9
    '11' > 9              // true -- '11' is coerced to 11
    123 > 'a'             // false -- 'a' is coerced to NaN; any comparison with NaN is false
    123 <= 'a'            // also false
    true > null           // true -- becomes 1 > 0
    true > false          // true -- also becomes 1 > 0
    null <= false         // true -- becomes 0 <= 0
    undefined >= 1        // false -- becomes NaN >= 1
    ```

- **Always use explicit type coercions** (covered in the previous topic).

- **Always use strict equality operators** (`===` and `!==`).

**Logical Operators**

​	The logical AND (`&&`) and logical OR (`||`) operators do not always return a boolean value. They return the value of one of their operands (i.e., the expressions being compared), which may be a non-boolean value such as shown above. You can learn more about the [logical operator rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators) on MDN.

The return value of a logical expression can be determined by iteratively evaluating the expression from left to right until it results in a single value.

```
!`, `&&`, and `||
```

- **!**
  - The **not operator** returns `true` when its operand is `false` and returns `false` when the operand is `true`. That is, it negates its operand.
  - In these examples, JavaScript first evaluates the expression on the right, then applies `!` to the result, thus negating it.
- **&&**
  - The **and operator** returns `true` when both operands are `true` and `false` when either operand is `false`.
- **||**
  - The **or operator** returns `true` when either operand is `true` and `false` when both operands are `false`.
- `&&` and `||` don't always return `true` or `false`, but they do when they operate on boolean values. A little later in this chapter we'll see what happens when we use `&&` and `||` with non-boolean values.
- The `&&` and `||` operators both use a mechanism called **short circuit evaluation** to evaluate their operands.
  -   As with `a && b`, JavaScript short circuits the evaluation if `a` is `false`, and returns `false` without evaluating `b`.

**Truthiness**

- javascript can coerce any value into a boolean value...

  - ```javascript
    let a = 5
    if (a) {
      console.log("how can this be true?");
    } else {
      console.log("it is not true");
    }
    
    //logs "how can this be true?"
    //coerces 5 to true
    
    let b = 0
    if (b) {
      console.log("how can this be true?");
    } else {
      console.log("it is not true");
    }
    
    //logs "it is not true"
    //coerces 0 to false
    ```

  - We often say that the expression **evaluates as** or **evaluates to** true or false.

```javascript
let x;

if (x = 5) {
  console.log("how can this be true?");
} else {
  console.log("it is not true");
}
```

- The above code doesn't test whether `x` is equal to `5`. Instead, it assigns the variable `x` to `5`, then evaluates the assignment's return value (`5`) as a boolean. Here, `5` evaluates as true when it appears in a boolean expression.

```javascript
> 3 && 'foo'  // last evaluated operand is 'foo'
= 'foo'

> 'foo' && 3  // last evaluated operand is 3
= 3

> 0 && 'foo'  // last evaluated operand is 0
= 0

> 'foo' && 0  // last evaluated operand is 0
= 0

> 3 || 'foo'  // last evaluated operand is 3
= 3

> 'foo' || 3  // last evaluated operand is 'foo'
= 'foo'

> 0 || 'foo'  // last evaluated operand is 'foo'
= 'foo'

> 'foo' || 0  // last evaluated operand is 'foo'
= 'foo'

> '' || 0     // last evaluated operand is 0
= 0
```

```javascript
let isOk = !!(foo || bar);
```

**String Concatenation** (see `510` in notes.md for a description)

- ```javascript
  > 'foo' + 'bar'
  = 'foobar'
  
  > '1' + 2					\\coerces number to string
  = '12'
  
  > '5' - 3					\\coerces string to number
  = 2
  ```

  - **Implicit Type Conversion**
    - Unlike Ruby, the number 2 is coerced into a string and then concatenated
    - No matter what.. undefined, null, Infinity + a string operand will always be coerced and concatenated

```js
> Number('1');
= 1

+('123')        // 123
+(true)         // 1
+(false)        // 0
+('')           // 0
+(' ')          // 0
+('\n')         // 0
+(null)         // 0
+(undefined)    // NaN
+('a')          // NaN
+('1a')         // NaN

> Number('foo');
= NaN
```

- When one of the operands is an object (including arrays and functions),  both operands are converted to strings and concatenated together: (non- mutating)

```js
[1] + 2                     // "12"
[1] + '2'                   // "12"
[1, 2] + 3                  // "1,23"
[] + 5                      // "5"
[] + true                   // "true"
42 + {}                     // "42[object Object]"
(function foo() {}) + 42    // "function foo() {}42"
```


- The other arithmetic operators, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, are only defined for numbers, so JavaScript converts both operands to numbers:

  ```js
  1 - true                // 0
  '123' * 3               // 369 -- the string is coerced to a number
  '8' - '1'               // 7
  -'42'                   // -42
  null - 42               // -42
  false / true            // 0
  true / false            // Infinity
  '5' % 2                 // 1
  > 9-'hi'
  NaN
  > 1-undefined
  NaN
  > 1+undefined
  NaN
  >[1] * 2;              // 2 -- becomes '1' * 2, then 1 * 2
  >[1, 2] * 2;           // NaN -- becomes '1,2' * 2, then NaN * 2
  >[5] - 2;              // 3
  >[5] - [2];            // 3
  >5 - [2];              // 3
  >5 - [2, 3];           // NaN -- becomes 5 - '2,3', then 5 - NaN
  >[] + [];              // '' -- becomes '' + ''
  >[] - [];              // 0 -- becomes '' - '', then 0 - 0
  >+[];                  // 0
  >-[];                  // -0
  ```

  **Coerce Number/Boolean to String**

  ```js
  > String(20); //function
  = '20'
  
  > (123).toString(); //method
  
  //can do this, but avoid it
  
  123 + '';                // "123"
  '' + 123.12;             // "123.12"
  
  
  String(true); 
  = "true"
  
  true.toString(); 
  
  1 + true       // true is coerced to the number 1, so the result is 2
  '4' + 3        // 3 is coerced to the string '3', so the result is '43'
  
  
  1 + true        // 2
  1 + false       // 1
  true + false    // 1
  null + false    // 0
  null + null     // 0
  1 + undefined   // NaN undefined gets coerced to NaN (which is still considered a number)
  ```
